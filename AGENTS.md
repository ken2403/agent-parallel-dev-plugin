# agent-parallel-dev-plugin

A Claude Code **plugin marketplace** (`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`) shipping
plugins for parallel development, plus a Codex repo marketplace
(`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`). Claude plugins are self-contained in their own
directories; Codex marketplace packages live under `plugins/`.

- **`sa`** — "Simple Agents": command-free skills + subagents for fast single-feature work (digest plan → approve → worktree → implement → PR; review cycle is on-demand), in `sa/`. See `sa/README.md`.
- **`ha`** — "Higher Agents": the thorough counterpart to `sa` for building ONE feature properly (deep red-teamed plan → SDD per-task loop + risk-scaled pre-PR adversarial gate → independent review → apply feedback → gated merge, plus standalone conflict resolution and worktree cleanup), in `ha/`. Single-feature, foreground, model-agnostic; leverages the `superpowers` disciplines (required dependency). See `ha/README.md`.
- **`ca`** — "Cooperate Agents": a Claude×Codex loop shipped as two co-located plugins (`ca/claude/`, `ca/codex/`). See `ca/README.md`.
- **`plugins/ha`** — the standalone Codex port of Higher Agents: the same lifecycle and safety gates, implemented with Codex skills and controlled subagents, with no Claude or `superpowers` runtime dependency. See `plugins/ha/README.md`.

Keep the plugins independent; don't let edits to one leak into another. To add
a plugin, create a new top-level dir with its own plugin manifest and add an
entry (with its `source` path) to the relevant marketplace.

## Common generated source

`common/` is maintained source for duplicated mechanical files shipped inside
`ha`, `sa`, and `ca/claude`: shared helper scripts, code-review reference docs,
the `code-review` standards skill (which carries the **canonical risky-surface
list** and the blocking rule "behavior change without a covering test", generated
into `ha`, `sa`, and `ca/claude`), and the mechanical `clean-worktrees` / `merge-pr` skills.
Generated copies stay committed in each plugin so every plugin remains
self-contained and installable alone.

Edit `common/src/`, `common/plugins/<slug>/vars`, or
`common/plugins/<slug>/fragments/`, then run `bash common/sync.sh`. Do not edit
generated copies directly unless you are intentionally changing the rendered
artifact and then back-porting that change into `common/`. `common/manifest.tsv`
lists generated destinations; `common/exclusions.tsv` lists intentional
duplication that must remain plugin-specific, with a reason.

`common/` is not a plugin and must never contain `.claude-plugin/`,
`.codex-plugin/`, or cross-plugin runtime references. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` resolve inside an installed plugin only.

> **Instruction-file convention:** `AGENTS.md` (this file) is the canonical,
> cross-tool instruction source (open standard; read by Codex and 30+ tools).
> `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it, so Claude Code reads the same content. Edit
> `AGENTS.md` only; never edit `CLAUDE.md` directly.

## ha layout

- `ha/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the only file in `ha/.claude-plugin/`.
- `ha/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — skills (also the slash commands `/ha:<name>`): `plan`, `implement`, `review-pr`, `apply-feedback`, `merge-pr`, `resolve-conflicts`, `clean-worktrees`, plus the auto-activating standards `code-review` and `adversarial-verification`. **Scripts are skill-local** under `ha/skills/<name>/scripts/`, referenced via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (aliased to `CLAUDE_SKILL_HA_DIR` in skill bodies); detail lives in `references/`. Shared helpers (`detect-base-branch.sh` ×4, `attach-or-create-worktree.sh` ×2, `new-worktree.sh`) are duplicated byte-identically into each skill that needs them.
- `ha/agents/<name>.md` — only `verifier` and `analyzer` (the invoked `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` supplies the implementer + task-reviewer). No `janitor` — cleanup is a script.
- `ha/hooks/{hooks.json,guard-protected.sh}` — PreToolUse secret-file guard (only plugin-level script, referenced via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`).
- **Single-feature, foreground; model-agnostic.** Every skill **omits** `model` (inherits the session model) and every agent uses `model: inherit` — no pinned IDs, no `opus` alias. **Two documented exceptions pin haiku** because their guardrails are mechanical, not judgment: `clean-worktrees` (only orchestrates `clean.sh`, which owns every rule — merged-only with positive proof, never the main checkout — the current worktree is removed too, but only if merged, run from the main checkout — no `--force`/`-D`) and `merge-pr` (preflight is field-equality checks on `gh pr view` JSON, and `gh pr merge` + branch protection refuse ineligible merges server-side). Effort: substantive skills `high` (`plan`/`implement`/`review-pr`/`apply-feedback`/`resolve-conflicts`); `merge-pr`/`clean-worktrees` `low`; standards skills omit it; `verifier`/`analyzer` `high`.
- **Leverage, not fork — `ha` hard-depends on `superpowers`** and **invokes** its disciplines via `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:<name>` markers (never `@skills/...` links): `brainstorming` + `writing-plans` (in `plan`; the plan doc is saved to the repo's plan dir — `docs/ha/plans/` by default, a `plan.dir:` CLAUDE.md hint or existing `docs/plans/` if present — **never** under `docs/superpowers/`, and Phase 4 verifies that), `subagent-driven-development` (the per-task loop in `implement`, scoped to stop before SDD's own finish; SDD's own workspace paths are left untouched and its `.superpowers/sdd/` scratch is excluded from the PR — never partially redirected), `verification-before-completion` (build gates), `receiving-code-review` (in `apply-feedback`), `systematic-debugging` (red paths), and `finishing-a-development-branch`'s guardrails (in `merge-pr`/`clean-worktrees`). ha's own power-ups are front-loaded: a **design red-team + test-rigor** pass in `plan` (catch defects as missing requirements/tests, not late review findings), `adversarial-verification`, the auto-activating `code-review`, the constructive-reviewer (SDD) / adversarial-verifier split, and a **risk-scaled pre-PR adversarial gate** in `implement` (deliberately lighter than the independent `/ha:review-pr`, scaled to the analyzer's risk grade — not a second full review).
- **Worktrees**: created by `implement/scripts/new-worktree.sh` under `.claude/worktrees/ha/<slug>` — persistent script-created (NOT native `EnterWorktree`, because they must outlive the session until the PR merges and `/ha:clean-worktrees` finds them by path), with a `using-git-worktrees` Step 0 reuse check. `apply-feedback`/`resolve-conflicts` isolate via `attach-or-create-worktree.sh` (reuse or create, **refuse** the main checkout). `code-review` is preloaded into `verifier` via its `skills:` frontmatter (subagents don't auto-activate skills by description).

## sa layout

- `sa/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — the only file in `sa/.claude-plugin/`.
- `sa/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` — skills (also the slash commands `/sa:<name>`): `simple-implement`, `review-pr`, `apply-feedback`, `merge-pr`, `resolve-conflicts`, `clean-worktrees`, and `code-review`. **Scripts are skill-local** under `sa/skills/<name>/scripts/`, referenced via `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (aliased to `CLAUDE_SKILL_SA_DIR` in skill bodies); detail lives in `references/`. Shared helpers (`detect-base-branch.sh`, `merge-check.sh`, `attach-or-create-worktree.sh`) are duplicated byte-identically into each skill that needs them.
- `sa/agents/<name>.md` — subagents (`implementer` **sonnet**·effort medium, `verifier` **sonnet**·effort high — the cheap fan-out cross-checker, `deep-verifier` **opus**·effort high — escalation only). No `janitor`/`analyzer` — sa stays light; risk grading is an inline heuristic in `simple-implement`, not an agent.
- `sa/hooks/{hooks.json,guard-protected.sh}` — PreToolUse secret-file guard (only plugin-level script, referenced via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`).
- **Model/effort**: all-Sonnet cross-checks with targeted Opus escalation — the thesis is **error-rate multiplication**: several cheap, independent checks (mandatory red-green, a risk-scaled pre-PR `verifier` pass in `simple-implement`, three mutually blind `verifier` lenses in `review-pr`) miss less together than one expensive correlated pass. Graded:
  - build & feedback: latest **Sonnet** (`simple-implement`/`apply-feedback`/`implementer` medium);
  - review/verify: **Sonnet** (`review-pr`/`verifier` high) with **deterministic escalation** to `deep-verifier` (**opus**·high) — triggers: risky surface / UNCERTAIN on a would-be-blocking claim / conflicting verifier verdicts; it gets only the unresolved claim, never a re-review;
  - `resolve-conflicts`: **opus**·high (rare, judgment-dense, silent-corruption risk; its integration check dispatches `deep-verifier`);
  - `merge-pr` + `clean-worktrees`: **haiku**·effort low (mechanical guardrails — merge-pr's preflight is field checks on `gh pr view` JSON with `gh`/branch-protection refusing ineligible merges server-side);
  - `code-review`: omits both (standards skill; carries the **canonical risky-surface list** and the blocking rule "behavior change without a covering test" — defined once in `common/src/skills/code-review` and generated into sa, ha, and ca/claude; other sa skills reference that list, never re-enumerate it).

  Models are pinned via the `sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku` aliases (not IDs) so they track the latest — `sa` is allowed to pin (unlike model-agnostic `ha`). Note a pin also **downgrades** a stronger session model by design (cost): the Opus look comes from escalation, not the session.
- **Worktrees**: created explicitly by `simple-implement/scripts/new-worktree.sh` under `.claude/worktrees/sa/<slug>`. `apply-feedback` and `resolve-conflicts` run in the same isolation via `attach-or-create-worktree.sh`, which **reuses** the branch's existing sa worktree or **creates** one (and **refuses** if the branch is checked out in the main checkout) — they never `gh pr checkout`/merge into the user's working copy. Every write skill enforces the absolute-path rule (edit only under `$WORKTREE_PATH`, `git -C`). `simple-implement` builds **red-green** (failing test captured before the implementation), runs a **risk-scaled pre-PR cross-check** (inline TRIVIAL/NORMAL/RISKY heuristic → 0/1/2 `verifier`s, one fix round max, fail-safe to a draft PR), then **stops at PR**; the review cycle (`review-pr`/`apply-feedback`) and `resolve-conflicts` are on-demand. `code-review` is the single standards skill (quality/test rigor/security/consistency): auto-activates in the main loop and is **preloaded** into the `implementer`/`verifier`/`deep-verifier` subagents via their `skills:` frontmatter (subagents don't auto-activate skills by description).

## Authoring rules (learned the hard way)

- **Identity by name field**: a skill's `name:` MUST equal its directory; an agent's `name:` MUST equal its filename. Validation and references break otherwise.
- **YAML frontmatter**: single-quote values starting with `[` (e.g. `argument-hint`); avoid a bare `: ` (colon-space) in plain scalars — both break the parser.
- **Side-effecting / irreversible skills** set `disable-model-invocation: true` so they run only on explicit invocation. In `ha`: `implement`, `apply-feedback`, `merge-pr`, `resolve-conflicts`, `clean-worktrees`. Entry/read-mostly skills (`plan`, `review-pr`) and standards skills do **not** (and standards skills must stay enabled so they can be preloaded into subagents — `disable-model-invocation` also blocks preload).
- **Subagent fan-out stays at the skill top level.** The platform now supports nested subagents (depth limited), but `ha` keeps all fan-out and all human questions (`AskUserQuestion`) in the skill's main loop for predictability — don't rely on a subagent spawning its own.
- **Plugin subagents ignore** `hooks`, `mcpServers`, `permissionMode`. A subagent's `cd` does not persist between Bash calls — use `git -C <root>` / absolute paths.
- **Cross-reference other skills by name**, via `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:<name>` markers — never `@skills/...` links (they force-load 200k+ tokens). `ha` leverages superpowers this way instead of vendoring it.
- **Scripts must be self-contained** (no `../` to the repo root) and referenced via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (hooks) / `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` (skill scripts) — keeps them cache-safe.
- **Single source of truth**: in `ha`, cleanup/guardrail logic lives in `clean-worktrees/scripts/clean.sh`; the review judgment axis lives in `code-review` + `skills/review-pr/SKILL.md`. Reference them; don't duplicate.
- **No time-sensitive info**: `ha` is model-agnostic — skills omit `model`, agents use `model: inherit`; never pin an ID like `claude-opus-4-8`.
- **Security**: never weaken the secret-file guard (`<plugin>/hooks/guard-protected.sh`); never let cleanup delete unmerged work.

## Validate before committing

- `claude plugin validate ./ha` (and `./sa`, `./ca/claude` if you touched them) — must pass.
- `bash common/sync.sh --check` and `bash common/tests/run.sh` — generated files
  must match `common/`. **Stage new files before trusting this**: the duplicate-coverage
  rule enumerates with `git ls-files`, so a brand-new duplicated path is invisible until it
  is tracked, and the check flips from green to red at the moment you commit.
- Skill `name:` ↔ directory and agent `name:` ↔ filename all match.
- `bash -n ha/skills/*/scripts/*.sh ha/hooks/*.sh sa/skills/*/scripts/*.sh sa/hooks/*.sh`.
- Generated helpers stay in lockstep by editing `common/` and rerunning
  `common/sync.sh`; CI enforces this instead of manual `md5` checks.
- Each `SKILL.md` body stays **under 500 lines** (push detail to `references/`).

## Git

- Branch off the default branch (e.g. `feat/<topic>`); commit/push only when asked.
- End commit messages with: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`.

## Working on the ca plugin

`ca` ("Cooperate Agents") is a Claude×Codex loop: **Claude drafts a milestone-grouped plan
(saved to `docs/ca/plans/` — never `docs/superpowers/`) and spars with Codex → Codex implements
it milestone by milestone in an isolated git worktree, opening a draft PR at the first milestone
and getting a Claude checkpoint review (`mode=checkpoint`) between milestones → Claude runs the
final review vs. the plan (≤2 rounds) → on approve Codex marks the PR ready with an exchange
summary → human merges → `/ca:clean-worktrees` reclaims it.**
Plus standalone `/ca:resolve-conflicts` and `/ca:clean-worktrees`, mirroring sa/ha.
It ships as two co-located plugins so each
tool scans only its own skills.

**Layout**

- `ca/claude/` — Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). Human entry points: `/ca:plan-loop`, `/ca:implement`, **`/ca:dual-review`** (the one way to review a PR), `/ca:merge-pr`, `/ca:resolve-conflicts`, `/ca:clean-worktrees`. `review-pr` and `synthesize-review` are the review's **internal legs**, invoked through `claude -p` by the loop and by `dual-review.sh` — one blind Claude review and one adjudication; their descriptions say so, so they are not offered as alternative review commands. `dual-review.sh --claude-only` is the single-model review that used to need its own command. `merge-pr`/`resolve-conflicts`/`clean-worktrees` are ported from `ha` but **agent-less** (ca ships no subagents; the shared `code-review` standards skill IS generated in — same criteria as sa/ha, applied inline by `review-pr`/`synthesize-review` instead of by subagents); their `detect-base-branch.sh` copies stay byte-identical.
- `ca/codex/` — Codex plugin (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, human entry skill
  `$ca-implement-plan`, plus the explicit-only internal `$ca-second-opinion` used by dual review).
- `plugins/ca/` — generated byte-identical marketplace package mirror of `ca/codex/`, required
  by the Codex repo marketplace's `./plugins/ca` source convention. Refresh/check it with
  `bash ca/sync-codex-plugin.sh [--check]`; never edit the mirror directly.
- `ca/tests/` — loop-level tests that span BOTH plugins (skill-local tests stay inside their
  skill). `loop-e2e-test.sh` drives the whole loop — worktree → implement → push → **draft PR
  open** → checkpoint review → dual final review → promote → summary → worktree reclaim —
  against a real bare remote and a hermetic `gh` (`support/gh-sim.py`), with the models stubbed,
  in three scenarios (approve / request_changes / blocked-with-no-findings). It runs in CI.
  `live-loop-e2e-smoke.sh` runs the SAME harness (`support/run-loop-e2e.sh`) with real Codex
  implementing and real Claude reviewing; opt-in via `--run`.
- `ca/install.sh` — installs the Codex skill into `~/.codex/skills`; prints the Claude install.
- `ca/README.md` — human-facing overview + install for both tools.

**Skill best practices (both tools share the SKILL.md open standard)**

- **Quick peer review:** `/ca:ask-codex-review` (Claude) and `$ca-ask-claude-review` (Codex)
  ask one fresh session of the other model to review the net default-branch merge-base → working-files
  diff, including non-ignored untracked files. No plan, PR, or prior conversation is required.
  The calling skill bundles the protocol, launcher, and canonical review standards; no reviewer-side
  plugin is needed. Reports are advisory and never gate PR promotion. Canonical peer launcher and
  protocol live in `ca/claude/skills/ask-codex-review`; `bash ca/sync-peer-review.sh` copies them into
  `ca/codex/skills/ca-ask-claude-review` and bundles standards from generated `ca:code-review` into both.
  Run `common/sync.sh` before peer sync when standards change, then `ca/sync-codex-plugin.sh`.
  The `--check` modes and `ca/tests/peer-review-test.sh` enforce copy identity and behavior in CI.

- A skill is a self-contained folder: `SKILL.md` + its own `scripts/` + `references/` (+ `assets/`). Helper scripts live INSIDE the owning skill's `scripts/`, never in a plugin-level `scripts/`.
- No `README.md` inside a skill folder; human READMEs live at the plugin/repo root.
- `SKILL.md` body under 5,000 words; push detail to `references/` (progressive disclosure); critical instructions first.
- Frontmatter `name` = folder name (kebab-case, ≤64). `description` = WHAT + WHEN (real trigger phrases); **no `<` or `>`; < 1024 chars**.
- Codex frontmatter allows only `name, description, license, allowed-tools, metadata` (no `model`/`effort`). Claude additionally allows `model`, `effort`, `disable-model-invocation`, `compatibility`.
- Side-effecting skills: Codex sets `agents/openai.yaml` → `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`; Claude sets `disable-model-invocation: true`.

**Model & effort**

- `ca-implement-plan` (Codex): set at session launch (`codex -m <model>`, `~/.codex/config.toml`, profile) — frontmatter can't carry it. The child `$ca-second-opinion` review is deliberately bounded by its skill-local launcher: reasoning defaults to `medium`; the exact bundled skill is materialized into an isolated temporary root and isolated `CODEX_HOME` (only file-based auth is linked); global instructions/skills/plugins/config are absent; apps, hooks, plugins, remote plugins, plugin sharing, Web search, and multi-agent are disabled; approvals are `never`; and the reviewed repository is read only as untrusted data. A capability preflight rejects older CLIs before launch.
- Claude-side skills are **model-agnostic** (omit `model`; in loop mode the review runs under the `claude -p` session's default model) with **ha-style graded effort**: `plan-loop`/`review-pr`/`resolve-conflicts` `effort: high`, `implement` `effort: medium`, `merge-pr` + `clean-worktrees` pinned **haiku** / `effort: low` (their guardrails are mechanical, not judgment: `clean.sh` owns every cleanup rule — merged-only with positive proof, never the main checkout (the current worktree is removed too, but only if merged, run from the main checkout), no `--force`/`-D` — and merge-pr's preflight is field checks on `gh pr view` JSON with `gh`/branch-protection refusing ineligible merges server-side; in ca a **draft** blocks the merge, since draft = the review loop has not approved).

**Loop rules**

- **Final** review capped at 2 rounds (`MAX_ROUNDS` default 2). **Milestone checkpoint reviews
  don't count against it**: plans group tasks into 2–4 milestones (plan-loop writes a
  `## Milestones` section; ≤4-task plans are a single milestone = no checkpoints); after each
  milestone except the last, Codex pushes and calls `/ca:review-pr` with `mode=checkpoint`
  (`--mode checkpoint` on `claude-review.sh`, output `review-checkpoint-<m>.json`), fixes
  blocking findings before the next milestone, with no checkpoint re-review — the final review
  verifies the fixes. Checkpoint verdicts never promote the PR; only a final-mode approve does.
- Implementation runs in a `ca/<plan-id>` worktree created by `new-worktree.sh` (a script, never the model, never `main`), located under `.claude/worktrees/ca/<plan-id>` to match `sa`/`ha`'s worktree convention (all three share the single `.claude/worktrees/` gitignore).
- **Draft-PR-first loop (the review reviews a *PR*, not a pre-PR diff).** Codex pushes and opens the **draft** PR at the end of the *first milestone* (single-milestone plans: before the final review), then calls `/ca:review-pr`; blocking findings keep it a draft. Promotion requires `verdict == approve` **AND** zero blocking findings, enforced by `promote-pr.sh` before it runs `gh pr ready`; `blocked` with an empty findings list never passes. The draft state is the fail-closed gate. `/ca:review-pr` fetches the PR via `gh pr diff`, takes `mode=checkpoint|final` (default final; checkpoint judges only the milestones built so far and never flags unbuilt later tasks), and emits the strict `ca_claude_review.v1` JSON the loop consumes (and, if a human runs it with no `CA_OUT`, prints an APPROVE/REQUEST-CHANGES summary). If the `pr=` input is absent it auto-detects the current branch's PR.
- **Dual-model final review, by default.** Final rounds use the same `dual-review.sh` parallel orchestrator as standalone review (`CA_DUAL_REVIEW=0` is the Claude-only opt-out; checkpoints stay Claude-only by design): a blind Claude `/ca:review-pr`, an offline Codex second-opinion leg (`codex-review.sh`, host-fetched PR data staged as files, explicit `$ca-second-opinion`, hardened read-only `codex exec`), and, when needed, a separate Claude `/ca:synthesize-review` call. The launcher materializes the exact bundled skill into an isolated temporary root and `CODEX_HOME`, disables ambient plugin/orchestration and network-capable browser/computer/image channels, restricts shell environment inheritance, and treats every reviewed byte — including target `AGENTS.md` — as untrusted data rather than instructions. It also binds the staged diff to a stable PR `headRefOid`, requires a matching clean worktree HEAD, and reviews an immutable archive of that commit. The current Codex artifact stays outside the worktree until blind Claude finishes. Codex findings are advisory untrusted claims; synthesis is the only place they can affect the final `ca_claude_review.v1` verdict. Clean full-coverage Codex output with zero findings skips synthesis (`clean_no_synthesis`); unavailable/invalid/timeout Codex degrades visibly to Claude-only with a `.ca/runs/<id>/review-round-N.meta.json` sidecar. A blind-Claude failure cancels the concurrent Codex launcher process group immediately; a synthesis failure deletes any partial final and records `synthesis.status: failed`. Checkpoints are intentionally Claude-only progress gates, not dual review: they cannot promote the PR, they run once per milestone, and in-loop the Codex leg is the implementer reviewing itself — measured twice at zero findings on its own work — so the heavier check is spent where it gates, on the final round.
- **A Codex-driven loop cannot run the Codex review leg.** `codex exec` nested inside a sandboxed Codex session fails with `failed to initialize in-process app-server client`, so a final review invoked from inside the implementing session degrades to Claude-only — visibly (`codex.status: unavailable` in the meta sidecar and in the PR summary). Verified by letting Codex drive the whole loop from SKILL.md. The dual review therefore materialises when the review step runs on the host, or via standalone `/ca:dual-review`; in-session it is single-model by circumstance. This is a second, independent reason the review steps want to run where network and `gh` work.
- **The in-loop Codex leg is self-review, not an independent second opinion.** Codex implements, then a fresh read-only `codex exec` reviews the same diff. Nothing it says can become blocking unless Claude confirms it in synthesis, but a clean Codex pass is the author approving their own work and must not be read as corroboration; the independent judgement is the blind Claude leg. Standalone `/ca:dual-review` on a PR Codex did not write is the case where the second opinion really is second.
- **Standalone dual review.** `/ca:dual-review [pr] [plan]` runs the same dual-model review outside the loop (re-review after a loop, or any PR): both legs in parallel via the skill's own byte-identical script copies (`dual-review.sh` orchestrates; CI enforces copy identity), plan optional (falls back to an intent file from the PR body), artifacts under `.ca/reviews/pr-<n>/`. Its verdict never promotes a draft PR — only the loop's final-mode approve does.
- **`claude -p` preconditions are three, not two.** Besides a resolvable `/ca:review-pr` and
  network+`gh`, the `-p` session must be allowed to run its tools: with the stock `default`
  permission mode it BLOCKS on an approval it cannot display and dies at the timeout with no
  output. `CA_CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` is passed through as `--permission-mode`; both review
  scripts capture `claude`'s **stdout** (where it reports these failures) alongside stderr.
- **Both plugins are required for the implementation loop.** The Codex plugin supplies `$ca-implement-plan`; the Claude plugin supplies `/ca:review-pr` and `/ca:synthesize-review`. Each owning dual-review launcher carries and materializes an exact copy of the internal `$ca-second-opinion`, so standalone `/ca:dual-review` needs the Codex binary but does not depend on an ambient Codex-plugin installation. Installing only one side still cannot run the full implement→review loop.
- Codex runs `-s workspace-write -c approval_policy=never` for implementation. The push, draft-PR, and review steps need **network + an authenticated `gh`** (`claude -p` reaches the API; `/ca:review-pr` fetches the PR via `gh pr diff`) — Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox blocks network, so run them where network+gh are allowed (network-permitted Codex launch/approval, or run `claude-review.sh` on the host). `claude-review.sh` fails loudly, naming all three possible causes (skill-not-installed / tool-permissions / network-or-gh) and echoing claude's stdout and stderr, if no review is produced. Capture `thread_id` from `codex exec --json`; resume by id, **never `--last`**.
- Every external model leg is time-bounded and non-interactive: plan sparring and Codex review use
  read-only Codex with approvals disabled; Claude review/synthesis use explicit timeouts. Codex
  review timeout kills its process group and retains a byte-bounded head+tail leg log.
  A timeout, non-zero process exit, missing file, or invalid contract never yields a usable verdict.
- Handoff contract: `ca_claude_review.v1` requires `schema_version`, `producer`, `round`, `mode`, `verdict`, `summary`, `findings`, and `verification`; validator-enforced coherence makes missing, malformed, or contradictory output fail closed — including `approve` alongside a `verification[].result == "fail"`. Synthesis-only fields are `second_opinion`, `resolved_blind_findings`, and `escalated_blind_findings`; inside a review JSON the only valid `second_opinion.status` is `used` (the other statuses are the meta sidecar's vocabulary). `ca_codex_review.v1` is intermediate advisory data only, carries the same `pr`/`head_sha` subject binding, and deliberately has no verdict field.
- **A verdict is bound to its subject.** `pr` and `head_sha` name the PR and the exact reviewed commit. `promote-pr.sh` resolves the PR's live head itself (`gh pr view --json headRefOid`) and refuses any verdict that omits the binding, names another PR, or names a commit the branch has moved past — so an approval cannot be replayed onto a different PR, and a post-review push invalidates it.
- **Synthesis accountability is symmetric.** Downgrading a blind blocker needs a `resolved_blind_findings[]` entry; raising a non-blocking blind finding to blocking needs an `escalated_blind_findings[]` entry. The validator rejects both silent drops and silent escalations, and rejects ledger ids the blind review never raised. Escalation is the move that turns an approve into request_changes, so it leaves a trail like every other gate change.
- **Blind isolation is two-way.** `dual-review.sh` keeps BOTH legs' artifacts in a private dir until BOTH finish. The Codex leg reviews an immutable archive of the PR head, not the live worktree, and clean-skip/synthesis require both legs to report the same `pr` and `head_sha`; publishing the blind verdict early would still make the "second opinion" an echo. The Codex prompt also tells it not to read `.ca/runs` / `.ca/reviews` (the mirror of the blind prompt's instruction), covering earlier rounds' artifacts.
- **The `code-review` standard is invoked, not merely cited.** `review-pr` and `synthesize-review` carry `Skill` in `allowed-tools` and a `**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use ca:code-review` marker. A live run where the reviewer graded a plan-required behaviour with no covering test as non-blocking (and promoted the PR) is why the rule is now stated as unconditional in `review-pr` and checked task by task in `verification[]`.
- Self-containment: `review-contract.md`, `validate-review.py`, review orchestrator scripts, and `new-worktree.sh` are intentionally duplicated into each skill that needs them; keep their designated copies byte-identical. CI compares `review-contract.md` and `validate-review.py` in a **star** against the `review-pr` master (found with `find`, so a newly added copy is checked automatically) — pairwise chains let two copies drift together and never notice.
- `new-worktree.sh` appends `.ca/` and `.claude/worktrees/` to the worktree's `info/exclude`, the way `ha` does for `.ha/`. Without it the loop's own run state is untracked in the target repo, which both risks being committed into the PR and makes `git worktree remove` (deliberately never `--force`) refuse forever, so `/ca:clean-worktrees` could never reclaim the worktree.

**Validate the ca plugins before committing**

- `claude plugin validate ./ca/claude` — must pass.
- Codex skill frontmatter: allowed keys only, `name` == folder, `description` ≤1024 with no `<>`. If PyYAML is available, run `~/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py` for every directory under `ca/codex/skills/`.
- `bash ca/sync-codex-plugin.sh --check` and validate `plugins/ca` with the Codex plugin validator.
- `bash ca/tests/loop-e2e-test.sh` — the whole loop through PR open, both gate answers.
  It is part of `validate-repo.sh`; a change to any loop script must keep it green.
- `bash -n ca/**/*.sh ca/install.sh`; `python3 -m py_compile` every bundled `*.py`; `ca/install.sh --dry-run`.
- No README inside any skill folder; no leftover identifiers from the previous working name.
