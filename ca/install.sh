# --codex   Copy the Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills (default ~/.codex/skills),
#           including the standalone Claude-review entry point.
# --claude  Print how to install the Claude Code plugin (marketplace or --plugin-dir).
# --force   Overwrite an existing installed skill directory.
# --dry-run Print planned actions without changing anything.
# --check   Verify the installed Codex skill exactly matches the repository source.
#
# With no flag, BOTH sides are handled — the loop needs BOTH plugins: the Codex skill
# implements, and it calls the Claude plugin's /ca:review-pr to review. Installing only
# one side makes every review round fail.
