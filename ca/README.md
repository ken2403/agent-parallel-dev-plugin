# ca — Cooperate Agents (Claude × Codex)

`ca` ships **two co-located plugins** that make Claude and Codex cooperate on one feature, end to end:

For everyday work, use **`/ca:ask-codex-review` in Claude** or
**`$ca-ask-claude-review` in Codex** to ask the other model for one independent review.
No plan, PR, or implementation workflow is required. See [Quick peer review](#quick-peer-review).

```

   │     ├─ Codex $ca-second-opinion (bounded, offline, single-agent advisory)
   │     └─ Claude /ca:synthesize-review adjudicates one ca_claude_review.v1 verdict
   ├─ address blocking findings, push, re-review the PR   (≤ 2 final rounds)
   └─ on validated approve + zero blockers: hard gate runs gh pr ready + posts summary
/ca:merge-pr (gated) or human merges ─▶ /ca:clean-worktrees reclaims it

Standalone (Claude): /ca:merge-pr [pr], /ca:resolve-conflicts [pr|branch], /ca:clean-worktrees
```

The implementing Codex session keeps continuous memory across rounds; state also lives in files
(`plan.md`, `review-checkpoint-M.json`, `review-round-N.json`) and in the PR itself, so the loop
is reproducible. Plans live in `docs/ca/plans/` (grouped into 2–4 milestones by `/ca:plan-loop`;
small plans are a single milestone and skip checkpoints). Codex implements sandboxed
(`-s workspace-write`); the push, draft-PR, `/ca:review-pr`, and `/ca:synthesize-review` steps
need network + an authenticated `gh`.

> **Network + `gh` note for the review step.** Claude review and synthesis call `claude -p`
> (needs the Anthropic API) and fetch the PR via `gh pr diff` (needs an authenticated `gh`).
> Codex's default
> `-s workspace-write` sandbox **blocks network**, so the review must run where network is allowed
> and `gh` is authenticated: launch Codex for ca with network permitted for that command
> (approval/profile), or run `claude-review.sh` in a host terminal between rounds. `claude-review.sh`
> fails loudly with guidance if no verdict is produced, so an unreachable reviewer is never mistaken
> for a real verdict.

Every checkpoint, final, and standalone PR review uses `gh pr diff`, so it reads the PR's configured
base rather than assuming the repository default branch. The current structured review contract
binds the verdict to the PR and head SHA, but not yet to the base commit SHA; rerun the final review
if the base advances before promotion or merge.

  sync-peer-review.sh     # refresh/check peer launcher and canonical standards copies
plugins/ca/               # generated, self-contained Codex marketplace package
```

Each skill is a self-contained folder (scripts bundled inside it) so it stays portable when copied
or distributed independently.

## Install

**Claude Code plugin** (plan + review side):

```bash
/plugin install ca@agent-parallel-dev-plugin      # from the marketplace
# or, for local development:
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/repo/ca/claude
```

**Codex plugin** (implementation + bounded second-opinion side):

```bash
# Plugin-aware Codex install from the latest main branch:
codex plugin marketplace add ken2403/agent-parallel-dev-plugin --ref main
codex plugin add ca@agent-parallel-dev-plugin

# For local repository development instead:
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/agent-parallel-dev-plugin

# Compatibility fallback — direct skill copy:
bash ca/install.sh
bash ca/install.sh --force
```

`ca/codex/` is the canonical Codex source. `plugins/ca/` is its byte-identical distribution
mirror for the marketplace's required `./plugins/ca` path; `bash ca/sync-codex-plugin.sh --check`
detects drift. The direct `install.sh` copy remains available for older/non-plugin-aware setups.

## Quick peer review

After implementing normally, ask the other model to review:

```text
# In Claude Code
/ca:ask-codex-review
/ca:ask-codex-review Check error handling and test coverage

# In Codex
$ca-ask-claude-review
$ca-ask-claude-review 認証とテストの抜けを重点的に確認して
```

Both skills work from a fresh conversation with no prior implementation context. The reviewer
discovers purpose from the captured diff, README, related code and tests. Optional user requirements
or focus are passed without the author's conversation or earlier review verdicts. Each skill carries
the complete review protocol and generated copies of ca's four review standards: quality, test rigor,
security, and consistency beyond the diff. The report includes the usual severity, file/line, issue,
evidence, recommended fix, verification, and limitations. Results are advisory and never promote PRs.

**Scope:** the net diff from the default branch's merge base to current working files, combining
branch commits, staged/unstaged edits, deletions, and non-ignored untracked files. Staged edits undone
locally cancel out. The launcher uses cached refs, records the actual base SHA, and accepts `--base`
when default detection is ambiguous. Fetch beforehand if the cached default branch is stale.

The current files are captured into a private temporary directory and checked for concurrent changes.
The reviewer reads that fixed copy. The real checkout and index are untouched. Secret-shaped paths,
review state, binary/large files, symlinks and submodules have explicit omission handling; omitted
changed files prevent an approve result. The launcher prints the exact scope and artifact path.
No automatic edits, test execution, PR comments, or repair loop occurs.
Missing sparse-checkout files must be expanded before review; missing partial-clone objects fail
without automatic fetching. Git must support `--no-lazy-fetch`. File/directory replacements retain
their deletion and addition patches. Codex authentication and runtime state live outside the input
packet and are removed after the run; the original credentials are untouched.
Submodule contents are unsupported and prevent approve. Git LFS and checkout-attribute conversions
are not run or normalized, so their raw working bytes may produce extra changes or omissions.

Install only the **calling side's skill/plugin**, plus Git, Python 3.9+, and the authenticated
reviewer CLI. The reviewer does not need an ambient ca installation. Both model adapters require
network access to their provider; neither requires `gh`. Required isolation flags are checked before
launch. Codex uses read-only sandboxing and an isolated configuration; Claude uses safe/restricted
mode and Read/Grep/Glob tools only. A timeout, missing CLI, incompatible version, or invalid result
is reported as review not performed, with diagnostic artifacts; there is no self-review fallback.

To inspect the packet without calling a model, run the installed skill's
`scripts/peer-review.py --reviewer claude --repo /absolute/repo --prepare-only`.
See the [launcher reference](claude/skills/ask-codex-review/references/launcher.md) for controls.

Maintainers: edit the launcher/protocol under `ca/claude/skills/ask-codex-review/`; edit the canonical
standards in `common/src/skills/code-review/` and run `bash common/sync.sh` first. Then run
`bash ca/sync-peer-review.sh` and `bash ca/sync-codex-plugin.sh`. CI checks both copies and runs
`bash ca/tests/peer-review-test.sh` against real temporary Git repositories and fake model processes.

## Implementation loop

1. `bash ca/install.sh && bash ca/install.sh --claude` — install both, restart Codex.
2. In Claude: `/ca:plan-loop "<your epic>"` → spars with Codex, saves a plan.
3. In Claude: `/ca:implement <plan>` → creates the worktree, prints the Codex command.
4. In a Codex session in that worktree (use a strong model + high reasoning):
   `$ca-implement-plan PLAN=<abs-plan-path>` → implements milestone by milestone, opens a
   **draft** PR at the first milestone, gets a Claude checkpoint review between milestones,
   then the final **dual review** (≤2 rounds), and on a validated approve marks the PR **ready**.
5. Merge the PR — `/ca:merge-pr [pr]` (gated: refuses drafts/red CI/conflicts) or on GitHub —
   then `/ca:clean-worktrees` reclaims the worktree and branch.

**Reviewing a PR by hand: `/ca:dual-review [pr] [plan-path]`** — the single entry point. It is the
loop's Claude×Codex final review as a command, usable on any PR at any time (including re-reviews
after the loop). Add `--claude-only` for a single-model review. A missing, invalid, or timed-out
Codex leg degrades visibly to Claude-only. Artifacts land in `.ca/reviews/pr-<n>/`.

`/ca:review-pr` and `/ca:synthesize-review` exist as that command's internal legs — the blind
review and the adjudication the orchestrator drives through `claude -p`. They are not second
entry points; invoking them by hand skips the orchestration they are designed to run inside.

Standalone Claude skills: `/ca:merge-pr [pr]` (gated merge — refuses drafts, red CI, conflicts;
in ca a draft means the review loop has not approved), `/ca:resolve-conflicts [pr|branch]`
(resolve base-branch conflicts in an isolated worktree) and `/ca:clean-worktrees` (reclaim merged
ca worktrees) — the same operations ha ships, adapted to ca.

## Tests

Two tiers, one harness (`ca/tests/support/run-loop-e2e.sh`) — the model layer is the only
difference, so the hermetic tier proves the wiring and the live tier proves the models:

```bash
bash ca/tests/loop-e2e-test.sh              # hermetic, in CI, ~8s, no network, no cost
bash ca/tests/live-loop-e2e-smoke.sh --run  # real Codex implements, real Claude reviews
```

Both drive the full loop and assert it reaches **PR open as a draft**, that a checkpoint verdict
can never promote, that promotion happens only on a validated final `approve`, and that the
worktree is reclaimable afterwards. GitHub is simulated (`ca/tests/support/gh-sim.py`) on top of
a real bare remote, so pushes, diffs and draft state are real without touching anyone's account —
the live tier additionally runs the synthesis leg directly, because the orchestrator skips it
whenever Codex returns a clean pass.

> **What the Codex leg is.** Inside the loop Codex is the implementer, so its review leg is a
> fresh-context **self-review** — read-only, no memory of the build, and unable to make
> anything blocking unless Claude confirms it in synthesis. A clean Codex pass there is the
> author approving their own work, not corroboration; the independent judgement is the blind
> Claude leg. Standalone `/ca:dual-review` on a PR Codex did not write is where the second
> opinion is truly second.

## The handoff contract

Claude review returns a strict `ca_claude_review.v1` JSON object that names the PR (`pr`) and
the exact commit it judged (`head_sha`). Promotion requires a final-mode `verdict: "approve"`,
zero blocking findings, and a binding that still matches the PR's live head; `promote-pr.sh`
resolves that head itself and enforces all of it before calling `gh pr ready`. So an approval
cannot be replayed onto another PR, and a commit pushed after the review invalidates it. A
`blocked` verdict never passes even with no findings, an `approve` cannot coexist with a failed
verification record, and missing/malformed/incoherent output fails closed. Checkpoint reviews
(`mode=checkpoint`) use the same contract but only gate continuing to the next milestone — they
never promote the PR. The contract lives in each skill's `references/review-contract.md`,
validated by `validate-review.py`.

## Dual-model final review (the default)

**Final** review rounds are dual-model by default; `CA_DUAL_REVIEW=0` is the Claude-only opt-out.
Checkpoints remain Claude-only progress gates — they cannot promote the PR, and in the loop the
Codex leg is the implementer reviewing its own work rather than an independent second opinion.
In a dual final round:

1. `dual-review.sh` starts both mutually blind legs concurrently and keeps the current Codex artifact
   outside the worktree until blind Claude finishes.
2. `codex-review.sh` fetches PR metadata/diff on the host, stages them as bounded untrusted-data
   files, materializes the launcher's exact bundled `$ca-second-opinion`, and runs hardened read-only
   `codex exec`. The child gets an isolated `CODEX_HOME` containing only a link to file-based auth,
   so global instructions/skills/plugins/config are absent; apps/hooks/plugins/remote plugins/plugin
   sharing/Web search/browser/computer/image-generation/multi-agent are disabled; shell commands
   inherit only the core environment and filter secret-shaped variables; approvals are `never`; reviewed paths are JSON
   encoded; and all subject data is untrusted. The PR head is checked before and after fetching,
   the launcher requires a matching clean worktree HEAD, and Codex reads an immutable archive of
   that commit rather than the live worktree. A capability preflight rejects unsupported CLIs.
3. `claude-review.sh` runs the normal blind Claude final review and is instructed not to read prior
   `.ca` review artifacts.
4. If Codex reports findings, warnings, or partial coverage, `synthesize-review.sh` invokes
   `/ca:synthesize-review`; Claude treats Codex output as untrusted claims and emits the one
   gating `ca_claude_review.v1` verdict.
5. If Codex exits clean with zero findings and full coverage, synthesis is skipped and the blind
   Claude JSON is final. If Codex is unavailable or invalid, the round degrades visibly to
   Claude-only and records the reason in `.ca/runs/<id>/review-round-N.meta.json`.

Clean-skip and synthesis require both legs to name the same `pr` and `head_sha`. A mismatch
invalidates the advisory leg and is recorded in the meta sidecar instead of mixing subjects.

If blind Claude fails, the concurrent Codex launcher process group is cancelled immediately;
the command does not wait out the Codex timeout. If synthesis fails, no final verdict survives and
the meta sidecar records `synthesis.status: failed` instead of remaining `pending`.

This adds model diversity, not author independence: Codex wrote the code, and a fresh Codex
review may share model-family blind spots with the implementer. Claude remains the sole verdict
holder. Flip-to-default criterion: after at least 5 real dual PRs, the confirmed-finding rate is
nonzero and the invalid/unavailable rate is below 20%.

## Both plugins are required

The full implementation loop needs **both** sides installed: the Codex plugin supplies
`$ca-implement-plan`; the Claude plugin supplies `/ca:review-pr` and `/ca:synthesize-review`.
Each dual-review launcher bundles the exact internal `$ca-second-opinion`, so standalone
`/ca:dual-review` needs a Codex binary but not an ambient Codex-plugin installation.
`bash ca/install.sh` with no flags installs all Codex skills and prints/checks the Claude side. If you cannot install the Claude plugin globally, set
`CA_CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR` so the review call can load it with `--plugin-dir`.

## Environment overrides

- `CODEX_BIN` — path to `codex` if it is not on `PATH` (e.g. a version-manager shim).
- `CLAUDE_BIN` — path to `claude` for the review call.
- `CA_CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DIR` — path to the `ca/claude` plugin dir; lets `claude-review.sh` load
  `/ca:review-pr` via `--plugin-dir` when the Claude plugin isn't installed globally.
- `CA_DUAL_REVIEW=0` — opt OUT of the dual final review, leaving Claude-only rounds.
- `CA_CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` — `--permission-mode` for the `claude -p` review sessions. The
  stock `default` mode cannot prompt non-interactively, so it hangs until the timeout.
- `CA_LIVE_SMOKE_BUDGET_USD` — spend ceiling for the opt-in live tests, default 25. It is a
  runaway guard, not a per-call estimate: `claude` refuses up front once session spend already
  exceeds it, so a too-small value fails every leg before any work happens.
- `CA_CODEX_REVIEW_TIMEOUT` — timeout for the Codex second-opinion leg, default 900 seconds.
- `CA_CODEX_REVIEW_REASONING_EFFORT` — bounded child-review reasoning effort, default `medium`;
  accepts `none|low|medium|high|xhigh|max`.
- `CA_CLAUDE_REVIEW_TIMEOUT` — timeout for each Claude review leg, default 900 seconds.
- `CA_CLAUDE_SYNTHESIS_TIMEOUT` — optional separate synthesis timeout; defaults to the Claude
  review timeout.
- `CA_CODEX_SPAR_TIMEOUT` — timeout for the plan-sparring Codex leg, default 900 seconds.
- `CA_CODEX_REVIEW_FULL_DIFF_BYTES` — full-diff prompt threshold, default 180000 bytes.
- `CA_CODEX_REVIEW_FALLBACK_PROMPT_BYTES` — structured fallback budget, default 360000 bytes.
- `CA_CODEX_REVIEW_PLAN_BYTES` — plan-input budget, default 120000 bytes.
- `CA_CODEX_REVIEW_LOG_BYTES` — retained Codex diagnostic budget, default 65536 bytes; oversized
  logs preserve both their beginning and end with an omission marker.
- `CODEX_HOME` — where the Codex skill installs (default `~/.codex`).
- `CA_BASE` — optional base-branch override; otherwise origin HEAD then a local
  `main|master|develop|dev` branch is detected.
